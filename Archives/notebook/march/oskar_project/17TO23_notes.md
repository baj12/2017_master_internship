# Friday, March 17th

## Done 
- [x] Understand all the pipeline and know all the commands to run

## To do
- Choose a model of each order (for determinating if we have to use EVM for all the orders)
- Finally testing EVM !!!!

## New idea
- Do a first filter to check which species has the oskar gene or by not by genome mapping with the oskar gene list
- After do only EMV_Augustus pipeline on species which don't have oskar sequence
    * If the species have already annotations, apply only Augustus
    * Else, apply all the pipeline

## _For the week-end_
- Begin Exonerate execution code


# Monday, March 20th

## To do
- Apply a first filter on genomes to skip which are already known to have oskar sequence

## Done
- [x] Test EVM (but something wrong after execute commands)
- [x] Update of genome\_search (some id are not updated according to eucrayotes to eukaryotes.txt)

## In progress
- Exonerate pipeline for finding Oskar (have to modify Exonerate command to be faster)


# Tuesday, March 21st

## Done
- [x] Have launched Exonerate on 200 genomes (hope that is works!)

## In progress
- Create a file which contain infos from all annotations genomes 

## To do
- Test EVM with data from NCBI
