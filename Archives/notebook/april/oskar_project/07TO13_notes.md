# Friday, March 7th

## Done
- [x] Worked on Augustus training (problem on Maker gff file)
- [x] Tried to understand Z stack 3D modeling in Blender
- [x] Downloaded all TSA of Diptera and used transeq on all the sequences

## In progress
- Working on diptera TSA to study utr evolution of Oskar


# Monday, March 10th

## Done
- [x] Analyzed hmmsearch output files with Leo
- [x] Updated of genome sequences of all insects (adding refseq sequences)


# Tuesday, March 11th

## Done
- [x] Installed Geneious database
- [x] Built tsa oskar fasta file

## In  progress
- Test Augustus training with Bombix mori

## To do
- Analyzing the alignment


# Wednesday, March 12th

## Done
- [x] Comparing augustus training tests
- [x] 20 new Oskar sequences in diptera tsa
- [x] Counting GCF per order
- [x] Get fasta HMM representant for Blattodea - Collembola - Orthoptera - Phasmatodea - Thysanoptera for preparing Augustus etraining input

## In progress
- Running optimize Augustus
- Running Transcriptomes pipeline


## To do
- Get annotations from Maker for Blattodea - Collembola - Orthoptera - Phasmatodea - Thysanoptera for preparing Augustus etraining input
- Get annotations of GCF genomes + fasta
